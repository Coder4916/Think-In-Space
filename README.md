## **Introduction**

The Think-In-Space Website was created alongside my friend, coach and mentor Elwyn Davies. It is a Life Coaching website designed to reach out to people seeking coaching, guidance or even referral.

Elwyn had been planning to get help with creating a website to compliment his life coaching work, and to advertise his persona and skills to a wider audience. The Code Institute's first milestone project was the perfect opportunity to get the ball rolling.

The main requirement of this project was to build a responsive, static front end site, with the main principle of making the website simple and easy to use.

After several discussions and mind mapping ideas, a strategy was implemented.

## **UX Development**

### **1. Strategy Plane**

UX research was carried out through discussion with:

- Elwyn Davies
- Previous clients
- Friends and family
- Work colleagues

### **User Stories**

#### **First Time User Goals**

1. As a first-time user, I want to be able to find the information I'm looking for quickly and easily and be able to navigate the website with ease.
2. As a first-time user, I want to learn about the owner and find out about their previous qualifications/experience.
3. As a first-time user, I want to know what type of coaching services the owner/website offers.
4. As a first-time user, I want to be able to locate the owners social media links to see their followings and find any potential reviews etc.
5. As a first-time user, I want to have the option to contact the owner further if required.
6. As a first-time user, I want access to business owner operating times.

#### **Returning User Goals**
  
1. As a returning user, I want to know if   there's a FAQs page for any questions I may have.
2. As a returning user, I want access to different ways of contacting the user further if required.
3. As a returning user, I want access to owner operating hours to book further coaching.
4. As a returning user I want to easily access further information as required.

#### **Frequent User Goal**
  
1. As a frequent user, I want to know if there will be chance to give feedback on the website.
2. As a frequent user, I want access to owner operating hours.
3. As a frequent user I want to access information easily.
4. As a frequent user I want to be able to contact the owner easily.

### **Research**

- Interviews with website owner

Numerous discussions with the website owner to understand their wants and needs from the website. Discussed strategy, functionality, theme and 'feeling'. As part of this, obtained photographs and soundbites to aid with the website design. Owner shared existing logo in order to guide the theme across the pages.

- Competitor research

Researched other coaching websites avaialable online. This aided me to understand what is feasible, what looks good in this sector and how other coaches present themselves. This reasearch led me to suggest the owner drop the initially suggested 'Unconventional Coach' name, as there are many other more 'unconventional' methods in comparison to his offering. The research led me to conclude that in this case, 'unconventional' wasn't appropriate and wouldn't add value.

- Sector Research

I researched articles and sites that focused on life coaching, which helped to guide me on the best approaches, taglines and language for the sector.

Examples of sites I reviewed to bolster my research:

[Top 10 Life Coaching Websites](https://paperbell.com/blog/life-coaching-websites/)

[Life Coaching Taglines](https://paperbell.com/blog/the-5-step-process-for-an-unforgettable-life-coaching-tagline/)

[What is Neurodiversity?](https://geniuswithin.org/what-is-neurodiversity/)

[6 best website builders for Life Coaches](https://www.websiteplanet.com/blog/best-website-builders-for-life-coaches/?cq_src=google_ads&cq_cmp=11118429292&cq_term=&cq_plac=&cq_net=g&cq_plt=gp&gclid=Cj0KCQjw_5unBhCMARIsACZyzS2Bhh3MQ7QewK3UK3YkML_UYDLsx-kCgIStd0Xwz-qnJVSeyeP-mhoaAruPEALw_wcB)

### **Project Goals**

The project goal is to provide an informational and promotional life coaching website 'Think-in-Space'. This site will make it easy for customers looking for life coaching to determine whether this is the right route and approach for them, and enable them to start the journey.

### **User Goals**

The target audience for this website is varied, as life coaching is available to all. The key thing is to enable those that are in need to find this coach, and make contact. Location is not important as the services are available remotely as well as face to face.

Specifically:

- People who require emotional support or guidance
- People interested in life coaching, looking to make a change

The user goal when using this website is to get comprehensive information about 'Think-in-Space' and enable them to make contact with the Coach to begin a coaching programme.

### **Business Goals**

- The life coaching sector is busy and has wide-ranging offerings. As such, the website must make it clear the style of coaching offered, and help the user to make the right decision for them.

The business goals of this site are:

- Create an online presence for the coach
- Introduce the coach to the customer base
- Acquire new customers to the business
- Provide information for people looking to begin life coaching
- To introduce life coaching as a concept to people who may not have otherwise considered it
- Using FAQs, reviews and testimonials to drive further engagement from returning users

[Back to top](#think-in-space)

### **Other Considerations**

Think-in-Space has a Business-To-Customer (B2C) product, in an emerging but busy market, which has considerations as below:

- Calming and friendly presence
- Minimal, to the point content
- The design stands out amongst competitors

### **Strategy Table**

Based on these research, goals, and the considerations above, I considered what should be implemented on the website. I mapped the ideas based on their importance (driven by business goals and user needs), and viability (given limited time and resources), to determine which ideas were going to be included and which were not:

| Features/Ideas             | Importance | Viability |
| -------------------------- |:----------:| ---------:|
|  A. Coach bio              |      5     |     5     |
|  B. Code of Ethics         |      5     |     5     |
|  C. Contact Details        |      5     |     5     |
|  D. Testimonials           |      4     |     5     |
|  E. FAQs                   |      4     |     5     |
|  F. Coaching overview      |      4     |     5     |
|  G. Links                  |      4     |     4     |
|  H. Social Media profiles  |      3     |     4     |
|  I. Guarantees             |      2     |     1     |
|  J. Mental Health Referal  |      3     |     2     |
|  K. Feedback Form          |      2     |     3     |

The chart below is the mapping of all of the opportunities. The yellow circle signifies which opportunities/ features have the highest combination of importance and viability.

### 2. **Scope Plane**

Based on the mapping in Strategy Plane, I decided to include these contents below in the website:

- Coach Bio and background; Introduces the user to the coach.
- How Coaching works; Will inform the user of what Life Coaching is, and whether it is the right choice for them.
- Contact form; which will include a request for a coaching session or further information depending on what the user needs.
- Frequently Asked Questions; which will further aid the user's decision based on the choice to try out Life Coaching.
- Location and approach; A map will be included, as well as suggestions based on where coaching could take place.
- Functionality requirements:
The user should be able to navigate easily through the website to access all the contents via a navigation menu.
- The user should have access to the owner's contact details as required
- The user will be able to access a series of testimonials via a user friendly carousel

### 3. **Structure Plane**

The website must have a simple structure with a user friendly navigation element to reach each page of information.Each site page will be broken down into sections, and organised so that the information tells a story, and leads the user to a contact page if they want to explore the subject further. The pages will have a consistent predictable template to help with usability and accessibility.

### 4. **Skeleton Plane**

Wireframes were created using Balsamiq to design the layout and interface of the website. The developer designed it with a good UI design in mind, which allows immediate interaction in first-time learning, and perfectly meets the needs of the intended audience.

The Balsamiq Wireframes/Website Design can be found in the link below:

[Balsamiq-wireframes.pdf](https://github.com/Coder4916/ci_milestone/files/12707116/Balsamiq-wireframes.pdf)

### 5. **Surface Plane**

#### **Color Scheme**

The colors used are primarily derived from the logo provided by the website owner. To create a cohesive color scheme from beginning to end. I used Color Wheel, Colour Picker and Coolors to identify complementary colours and wider colours palettes that would work on the website.

[Color Wheel](https://www.canva.com/colors/color-wheel/)

[Color Picker](https://www.google.com/search?q=color+picker&oq=color&aqs=chrome.3.0i67i433i650j69i57j69i59l2j0i67i650l3j69i61.2852j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8&bshm=rime/1)

[Coolers](https://coolors.co/)

#### **Typography**

The fonts I used for the website were sourced from Google Fonts. Inc Roboto and Lexend. Lexend used for titles and Roboto for paragraphs/general text. Both fonts are recommended for use for people with dysleia [(Tink 'n' Stink)](https://www.tinknstink.co.uk/blogs/news/why-we-use-the-dyslexia-friendly-font-lexend). Fall back font Sans Serif.

[Lexend Font](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Lexend?query=lexend)

[Roboto](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto?query=roboto)

#### **Imagery**

I have utilised a mix of free to use images sourced online, and the Coach's personal pictures of local green space/blue space etc.

## **Issues and Bugs**

- Issue: Understanding Bootstrap 5, and being aware of updates. Eg. the class ".no gutters", to remove automatic padding that Bootstrap provides with .div rows and columns, became the class ".g-0".

- Issue: Trying to remove a Bootstrap 5 color from the .active nav-bar, and having to add !Important to CSS to overide.

- Issue: When trying to make the NavBar responsive, it was found that this could also be done via a Bootstrap 5 .fluid class.

- Issue: Ports not working/updating several times on Codeanywhere IDE. I regularly had to change the Port/reset to make the updates to the site work, so I could see my progress.

- Issue/Bug: README.md automatically began deleting itself while updating, when laptop was plugged into a smart tv. README.md had to be copied and pasted from Github repository.

## **Deployment**

The Website was developed using Codeanywhere as the IDE, commited to Git as a local repository and finally pushed/stored to GitHub.

### **Deployment to GitHub Pages**

The website was deployed to Github pages using the following steps:

1. Log in to GitHub.
2. Navigate to the main page of GitHub Repository that will be deployed.
3. At the top of the Repository, locate the "Settings" button on the menu and click it.
4. Inside the Settings, on the left side of the page, there’s a list of tab menu. Locate the “Pages” tab, and click it.
5. Under "Source", click the dropdown called "None", select "Master", and then click the “Save” button.
6. The page will automatically refresh.
7. There’s a notification message that provides the now published site link:

### **Forking the Github Repository**

By forking the GitHub repository you can make a copy of the original repository on your GitHub account to view and/or make changes without affecting the original repository, by using the following steps:

1. Log in to GitHub.
2. Navigate to the main page of the GitHub Repository that you want to fork.
3. At the top right of the Repository just below your profile picture, locate the "Fork" Button.
4. You should now have a copy of the original repository in your GitHub account.  

Changes made to the forked repository can be merged with the original repository via a pull request.

### **Making a Local Clone**

By cloning a GitHub Repository you can create a local copy on your computer of the remote repository. This allows you to make all of your edits locally rather than directly in the source files of the origin repository, by using the following steps:

1. Log in to GitHub.
2. Navigate to the main page of the GitHub Repository that you want to clone.
3. Above the list of files, click the dropdown called "Code".
4. To clone the repository using HTTPS, under "HTTPS", copy the link.
5. Open Git Bash.
6. Change the current working directory to the location where you want the cloned directory to be made.
7. Type git clone, and then paste the URL you copied in Step 4.
8. Press Enter. Your local clone will be created.
