#Think-In-Space.

##Table of Contents.

##Introduction.

The Think-In-Space Website was created alongside my friend, coach and mentor Elwyn Davies. It is a Life Coaching website designed to
reach out to people seeking coaching, guidance or even referral.

Elwyn had been planning to get help with creating a website to compliment his life coaching work, and to advertise his persona and
skills to a wider audience. The Code Institute's first milestone project was the perfect opportunity to get the ball rolling.

After several discussions and mind mapping ideas, a strategy was implemented. 

The main requirements of this project were to build a responsive, static front end site, with the main principle of making 
the website simple and easy to use.

Research

1. Interviews with website owner: Numerous discussions with the website owner to understand their wants and needs from the website. Discussed strategy, functionality, theme and 'feeling'. As part of this, obtained photographs and soundbites to aid with the website design. Owner shared existing logo in order to guide the theme across the pages.

2. Competitor research: Researched other coaching websites avaialable online. This aided me to understand what is feasible, what looks cood in this sector and how other coaches present themselves. This reasearch led me to suggest the owner drop 'the unconventional coach' part of his name, as there are many other more 'unconventional' methods in comparison to his offering. The research led me to conclude that in this case, 'unconventional' wasn't appropriate and wouldn't add value. 

3. Secotr Research: I researched articles and sites that focused on life coaching, wiich lelped to guide me on the best approaches, taglines and language for the sector.

   Project Goals
   The project goal is to provide an informational and promotional website for 'Think-in-Space'. This site will make it easy for customers looking for life coaching to determine whether this is the right route and approach for them, and enable them to start the journey.

   User Goals
   
   The target audience for this website is varied, as life coaching is available to all. The key thing is to enable those that are in need to find this coach, and make contact. Location is not important as the services are available remotelys as well as face to face.

   Specifically:
   People who require emotional support or guidance.
   People intereseed in life coaching, looking to make a change

   The users goal when using this website is to get comprehensive information about 'Think-in-Space' and enable them to make contact with the coach to begin a coaching programme.

   Business Goals

   The life coaching sector is busy and has wide-ranging offerings. As such, the website must make it clear the style of coaching offered, and help the user to make the right decision for them.

   The business goals of this site are:
   Create an online presence for the coach;
   Introduce the coach to the customer base;
   Acquire new customers to the business;
   Provide information for people looking to begin life coaching;
   To introduce life coaching as concept to people who may not have otherwise considered it;
   Using FAQs, reviews and testimonials to drive further engagement from returning users.

   Other Considerations
   
  Think-in-Space has a Business-To-Customer (B2C) product, in  an emerging but busy market, which has considerations as below:
  Calming and friendly presence
  Minima, to the point content

  Strategy Table

  Based on these research, goals, and the considerations above, I considered what should be implemented on the website. I mapped the ideas based on their importance (driven by business goals and user needs), and viability (given limited time and resources), to determine which ideas were going to be included and which were not.

Features/Ideas	Importance	Viability
A. Coach bio	5	5
B. Code of Ethics	5	5
C. Contact Details	5	5
D. Testimonials	4	5
E. FAQs	4	5
F. Coaching overview	4	5
G. Links	4	4
H. Social Media profiles	3	4
I. Guarantees	2	1
J. Mental Health Referal process	1	2
K. Feedback Form	2	3

The chart below is the mapping of all of the opportunities. The yellow circle signifies which opportunities/ features have the highest combination of importance and viability.

##4 Skeleton Plance

Wireframes were created using Balsamiq to design the layout and interface of the website. The developer designed it with a good UI design in mind, which allows immediate interaction in first-time learning, and perfectly meets the needs of the intended audience.

The wireframes can be found in the link below:

##5 Surface Plane

Color Scheme
The colors used are primarily derived from the logo provided by the website owner. To create a cohesive color scheme from beginning to end. I used Color Wheel and Colour Picker to identify complementary colours and wider colours palettes that would work on the website.
