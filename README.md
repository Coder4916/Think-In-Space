#Think-In-Space.

##Table of Contents.

##Introduction.

The Think-In-Space Website was created alongside my friend, coach and mentor Elwyn Davies. It is a Life Coaching website designed to
reach out to people seeking coaching, guidance or even referral.

Elwyn had been planning to get help with creating a website to compliment his life coaching work, and to advertise his persona and
skills to a wider audience. The Code Institute's first milestone project was the perfect opportunity to get the ball rolling.

After several discussions and mind mapping ideas, a strategy was implemented. 

The main requirements of this project were to build a responsive, static front end site, with the main principle of making 
the website simple and easy to use.
