## Introduction

The Think-In-Space Website was created alongside my friend, coach and mentor Elwyn Davies. It is a Life Coaching website designed to
reach out to people seeking coaching, guidance or even referral.

Elwyn had been planning to get help with creating a website to compliment his life coaching work, and to advertise his persona and
skills to a wider audience. The Code Institute's first milestone project was the perfect opportunity to get the ball rolling.

After several discussions and mind mapping ideas, a strategy was implemented.

The main requirement of this project is to build a responsive, static front end site, with the main principle of making
the website simple and easy to use.

## UX Development

### 1. Strategy Plane

UX research was carried out through discussion with:

* Elwyn Davies

* Previous clients.

* Friends and family.

* Work colleagues.

### i User Stories

#### First Time User Story

* As a first-time user, I want to be able to find the information I'm looking for quickly and easily.

* As a first-time user, I want to be able to navigate the website with ease.

* As a first-time user, I want to learn about the owner and find out about their previous qualifications/experience.

* As a first-time user, I want to know what type of coaching services the owner/website offers.

* As a first-time user, I want to be able to locate the owners social media links to see their followings and find any potential reviews etc.

* As a first-time user, I want to have the option to contact the owner further if required.

* As a first-time user, I want access to business owner operating times.

#### Returning User Story

* As a returning user, I want to know if there's a FAQs page for any questions I may have.

* As a returning user, I want access to different ways of contacting the user further if required.

* As a returning user, I want access to owner operating hours to book further coaching.

* As a returning user I want to easily access further information as required.

#### Frequent User Story

* As a frequent user, I want to know if there will be chance to give feedback on the website.

* As a frequent user, I want access to owner operating hours.

* As a rfrequent user I want to access information easily.

* As a frequent user I want to be able to contact the owner easily.

### ii Research

Interviews with website owner: Numerous discussions with the website owner to understand their wants and needs from the website. Discussed strategy, functionality, theme and 'feeling'. As part of this, obtained photographs and soundbites to aid with the website design. Owner shared existing logo in order to guide the theme across the pages.

Competitor research: Researched other coaching websites avaialable online. This aided me to understand what is feasible, what looks cood in this sector and how other coaches present themselves. This reasearch led me to suggest the owner drop 'the unconventional coach' part of his name, as there are many other more 'unconventional' methods in comparison to his offering. The research led me to conclude that in this case, 'unconventional' wasn't appropriate and wouldn't add value.

Sector Research: I researched articles and sites that focused on life coaching, wiich helped to guide me on the best approaches, taglines and language for the sector.

Examples of sites I reviewed:

   [Life Coaching Websites @ PaperBell.com](https://paperbell.com/blog/life-coaching-websites/)

   [Call To Actions @ hubspot.com](https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/call-to-action-examples)

   [Info on Neurodiversity @ geniuswithin.org](https://geniuswithin.org/what-is-neurodiversity/)

   [More ideas @ websiteplanet.com](https://www.websiteplanet.com/blog/best-website-builders-for-life-coaches/?cq_src=google_ads&cq_cmp=11118429292&cq_term=&cq_plac=&cq_net=g&cq_plt=gp&gclid=Cj0KCQjw_5unBhCMARIsACZyzS2Bhh3MQ7QewK3UK3YkML_UYDLsx-kCgIStd0Xwz-qnJVSeyeP-mhoaAruPEALw_wcB)

### iii Project Goals

The project goal is to provide an informational and promotional website for 'Think-in-Space'. This site will make it easy for customers looking for life coaching to determine whether this is the right route and approach for them, and enable them to start the journey.

### iv User Goals

The target audience for this website is varied, as life coaching is available to all. The key thing is to enable those that are in need to find this coach, and make contact. Location is not important as the services are available remotely as well as face to face.

Specifically:
People who require emotional support or guidance.
People interested in life coaching, looking to make a change

   The users goal when using this website is to get comprehensive information about 'Think-in-Space' and enable them to make contact with the coach to begin a coaching programme.

### v Business Goals

   The life coaching sector is busy and has wide-ranging offerings. As such, the website must make it clear the style of coaching offered, and help the user to make the right decision for them.

   The business goals of this site are:
   Create an online presence for the coach;
   Introduce the coach to the customer base;
   Acquire new customers to the business;
   Provide information for people looking to begin life coaching;
   To introduce life coaching as concept to people who may not have otherwise considered it;
   Using FAQs, reviews and testimonials to drive further engagement from returning users.

### vi Other Considerations

Think-in-Space has a Business-To-Customer (B2C) product, in  an emerging but busy market, which has considerations as below:
Calming and friendly presence
Minimal, to the point content

### vii Strategy Table

  Based on these research, goals, and the considerations above, I considered what should be implemented on the website. I mapped the ideas based on their importance (driven by business goals and user needs), and viability (given limited time and resources), to determine which ideas were going to be included and which were not:

| Features/Ideas             | Importance | Viability |
| -------------------------- |:----------:| ---------:|
|  A. Coach bio              |      5     |     5     |
|  B. Code of Ethics         |      5     |     5     |
|  C. Contact Details        |      5     |     5     |
|  D. Testimonials           |      4     |     5     |
|  E. FAQs                   |      4     |     5     |
|  F. Coaching overview      |      4     |     5     |
|  G. Links                  |      4     |     4     |
|  H. Social Media profiles  |      3     |     4     |
|  I. Guarantees             |      2     |     1     |
|  J. Mental Health Referal  |      3     |     2     |
|  K. Feedback Form          |      2     |     3     |

The chart below is the mapping of all of the opportunities. The yellow circle signifies which opportunities/ features have the highest combination of importance and viability.

## 2. Scope Plane

Based on the mapping in Strategy Plane, I decided to include these contents below in the website:

Coach Bio and background (Home)
How Coaching works (Why Life Coaching & What to Expect)
Contact form, contact details and map
Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)
Location and approach (types of contact)

Functionality requirements:

The user should be able to navigate easily through the website to access all the contents via a Navigation Menu
The user should have access to the owner's contact details as required
The user will be able to access a series of testimonials via a user friendly carousel

## 4. Skeleton Plance

Wireframes were created using Balsamiq to design the layout and interface of the website. The developer designed it with a good UI design in mind, which allows immediate interaction in first-time learning, and perfectly meets the needs of the intended audience.

The wireframes can be found in the link below:

## 5. Surface Plane

Color Scheme
The colors used are primarily derived from the logo provided by the website owner. To create a cohesive color scheme from beginning to end. I used Color Wheel, Colour Picker and Coolors to identify complementary colours and wider colours palettes that would work on the website.

[Color Wheel](https://www.canva.com/colors/color-wheel/)
[Color Picker](https://www.google.com/search?q=color+picker&oq=color&aqs=chrome.3.0i67i433i650j69i57j69i59l2j0i67i650l3j69i61.2852j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8&bshm=rime/1)
[Coolers](https://coolors.co/28464b-326771-2c8c99-42d9c8)

### Typography

The fonts I used for the website were sourced from Google Fonts. Inc Roboto and Lexend. Lexend used for titles and Roboto for paragraphs/general text. Both fonts are recommended for use for people with dyslexia [Tink 'n' Stink](https://www.tinknstink.co.uk/blogs/news/why-we-use-the-dyslexia-friendly-font-lexend). Fall back font Sans Serif.

[Info on Roboto font](https://resources.mygov.scot/design-standards/design-essentials/typography/#:~:text=As%20a%20sans%2Dserif%20font,with%20dyslexia%20and%20visual%20impairment.)

[Roboto @ Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto?query=roboto)

### Imagery

I have used a mix of online images/pexels and the coaches personal pictures of green space etc.
