## Introduction

The Think-In-Space Website was created alongside my friend, coach and mentor Elwyn Davies. It is a Life Coaching website designed to
reach out to people seeking coaching, guidance or even referral.

Elwyn had been planning to get help with creating a website to compliment his life coaching work, and to advertise his persona and
skills to a wider audience. The Code Institute's first milestone project was the perfect opportunity to get the ball rolling.

After several discussions and mind mapping ideas, a strategy was implemented.

The main requirement of this project is to build a responsive, static front end site, with the main principle of making
the website simple and easy to use.

## UX Development

### 1. Strategy Plane

UX research was carried out through discussion with:

* Elwyn Davies

* Previous clients.

* Friends and family.

* Work colleagues.

### i User Stories

#### First Time User Story

* As a first-time user, I want to be able to find the information I'm looking for quickly and easily.

* As a first-time user, I want to be able to navigate the website with ease.

* As a first-time user, I want to learn about the owner and find out about their previous qualifications/experience.

* As a first-time user, I want to know what type of coaching services the owner/website offers.

* As a first-time user, I want to be able to locate the owners social media links to see their followings and find any potential reviews etc.

* As a first-time user, I want to have the option to contact the owner further if required.

* As a first-time user, I want access to business owner operating times.

#### Returning User Story

* As a returning user, I want to know if there's a FAQs page for any questions I may have.

* As a returning user, I want access to different ways of contacting the user further if required.

* As a returning user, I want access to owner operating hours to book further coaching.

* As a returning user I want to easily access further information as required.

#### Frequent User Story

* As a frequent user, I want to know if there will be chance to give feedback on the website.

* As a frequent user, I want access to owner operating hours.

* As a rfrequent user I want to access information easily.

* As a frequent user I want to be able to contact the owner easily.

### ii Research

Interviews with website owner: Numerous discussions with the website owner to understand their wants and needs from the website. Discussed strategy, functionality, theme and 'feeling'. As part of this, obtained photographs and soundbites to aid with the website design. Owner shared existing logo in order to guide the theme across the pages.

Competitor research: Researched other coaching websites avaialable online. This aided me to understand what is feasible, what looks cood in this sector and how other coaches present themselves. This reasearch led me to suggest the owner drop 'the unconventional coach' part of his name, as there are many other more 'unconventional' methods in comparison to his offering. The research led me to conclude that in this case, 'unconventional' wasn't appropriate and wouldn't add value.

Sector Research: I researched articles and sites that focused on life coaching, wiich helped to guide me on the best approaches, taglines and language for the sector.

Examples of sites I reviewed:

   [Life Coaching Websites @ PaperBell.com](https://paperbell.com/blog/life-coaching-websites/)

   [Call To Actions @ hubspot.com](https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/call-to-action-examples)

   [Info on Neurodiversity @ geniuswithin.org](https://geniuswithin.org/what-is-neurodiversity/)

   [More ideas @ websiteplanet.com](https://www.websiteplanet.com/blog/best-website-builders-for-life-coaches/?cq_src=google_ads&cq_cmp=11118429292&cq_term=&cq_plac=&cq_net=g&cq_plt=gp&gclid=Cj0KCQjw_5unBhCMARIsACZyzS2Bhh3MQ7QewK3UK3YkML_UYDLsx-kCgIStd0Xwz-qnJVSeyeP-mhoaAruPEALw_wcB)

### iii Project Goals

The project goal is to provide an informational and promotional website for 'Think-in-Space'. This site will make it easy for customers looking for life coaching to determine whether this is the right route and approach for them, and enable them to start the journey.

### iv User Goals

The target audience for this website is varied, as life coaching is available to all. The key thing is to enable those that are in need to find this coach, and make contact. Location is not important as the services are available remotely as well as face to face.

Specifically:
People who require emotional support or guidance.
People interested in life coaching, looking to make a change

   The users goal when using this website is to get comprehensive information about 'Think-in-Space' and enable them to make contact with the coach to begin a coaching programme.

### v Business Goals

   The life coaching sector is busy and has wide-ranging offerings. As such, the website must make it clear the style of coaching offered, and help the user to make the right decision for them.

   The business goals of this site are:
   Create an online presence for the coach;
   Introduce the coach to the customer base;
   Acquire new customers to the business;
   Provide information for people looking to begin life coaching;
   To introduce life coaching as concept to people who may not have otherwise considered it;
   Using FAQs, reviews and testimonials to drive further engagement from returning users.

### vi Other Considerations

Think-in-Space has a Business-To-Customer (B2C) product, in  an emerging but busy market, which has considerations as below:

* Calming and friendly presence,
* Minimal, to the point content.

### vii Strategy Table

  Based on these research, goals, and the considerations above, I considered what should be implemented on the website. I mapped the ideas based on their importance (driven by business goals and user needs), and viability (given limited time and resources), to determine which ideas were going to be included and which were not:

| Features/Ideas             | Importance | Viability |
| -------------------------- |:----------:| ---------:|
|  A. Coach bio              |      5     |     5     |
|  B. Code of Ethics         |      5     |     5     |
|  C. Contact Details        |      5     |     5     |
|  D. Testimonials           |      4     |     5     |
|  E. FAQs                   |      4     |     5     |
|  F. Coaching overview      |      4     |     5     |
|  G. Links                  |      4     |     4     |
|  H. Social Media profiles  |      3     |     4     |
|  I. Guarantees             |      2     |     1     |
|  J. Mental Health Referal  |      3     |     2     |
|  K. Feedback Form          |      2     |     3     |

The chart below is the mapping of all of the opportunities. The yellow circle signifies which opportunities/ features have the highest combination of importance and viability.

## 2. Scope Plane

Based on the mapping in Strategy Plane, I decided to include these contents below in the website:

* Coach Bio and background; Introduces the user to the coach.
* How Coaching works; Will inform the user of what Life Coaching is, and whether it is the right choice for them.
* Contact form; which will include a request for a coaching session or further information depending on what the user needs.
* Frequently Asked Questions; which will further aid the user's decision based on the choice to try out Life Coaching.
* Location and approach; A map will be included, as well as suggestions based on where coaching could take place.

### Functionality requirements:

* The user should be able to navigate easily through the website to access all the contents via a Navigation Menu
* The user should have access to the owner's contact details as required
* The user will be able to access a series of testimonials via a user friendly carousel

## 3. Structure Plane

The website must have a simple structure with a user friendly navigation element to reach each category of information. The site will be broken down into sections, and organised so that the information tells a story, and leads the user to a contact page if they want to explore the subject further. The pages will have a consistent predictable template to help with usability and accessibility.

## 4. Skeleton Plane

Wireframes were created using Balsamiq to design the layout and interface of the website. The developer designed it with a good UI design in mind, which allows immediate interaction in first-time learning, and perfectly meets the needs of the intended audience.

The wireframes can be found in the link below:

## 5. Surface Plane

Color Scheme
The colors used are primarily derived from the logo provided by the website owner. To create a cohesive color scheme from beginning to end. I used Color Wheel, Colour Picker and Coolors to identify complementary colours and wider colours palettes that would work on the website.

[Color Wheel](https://www.canva.com/colors/color-wheel/)
[Color Picker](https://www.google.com/search?q=color+picker&oq=color&aqs=chrome.3.0i67i433i650j69i57j69i59l2j0i67i650l3j69i61.2852j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8&bshm=rime/1)
[Coolers](https://coolors.co/28464b-326771-2c8c99-42d9c8)

### Typography

The fonts I used for the website were sourced from Google Fonts. Inc Roboto and Lexend. Lexend used for titles and Roboto for paragraphs/general text. Both fonts are recommended for use for people with dysleia [Tink 'n' Stink](https://www.tinknstink.co.uk/blogs/news/why-we-use-the-dyslexia-friendly-font-lexend). Fall back font Sans Serif.

[Info on Roboto font](https://resources.mygov.scot/design-standards/design-essentials/typography/#:~:text=As%20a%20sans%2Dserif%20font,with%20dyslexia%20and%20visual%20impairment.)

[Lexend @ Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Lexend)

[Roboto @ Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto?query=roboto)

### Imagery

I have used a mix of online images/pexels and the coaches personal pictures of green space etc.

## Technologies Used

### Coding Languages used:

HTML5 was used to create the front end framework of the website.

CSS3 was used to design the layout and aesthetics of the website, including using effective typography and complimentary colors that would improve UX.

Javascript; JavaScript was used to implement functions that allowed the Hamburger menu in Navbar to close/collapse back after choosing, and a carousel to display several testimonials. Both were applied for a better UX.

### Frameworks, Libraries and Programs Used

Bootstrap 5.3
Bootstrap was used to assist with the responsiveness and styling of the website.
Google Fonts
Google fonts was used to import the “Roboto”, “Lexend” fonts into the html file, and were used on all parts of the site.
Font Awesome
Font Awesome was used throughout the website to add icons for aesthetic and UX purposes.
Codeanywhere App
The Codeanywhere IDE was used for creating the website and using the built in terminal to push the site to GitHub.
GitHub
GitHub was used to store the projects code after being pushed from Codeanywhere.
Balsamiq
Balsamiq was used to create the wireframes and the high fidelity mock up during the design process.

Autoprefixer CSS
Autoprefixer CSS was used to add vendor prefixes to the CSS rules, to ensure that they work across all browsers.

Am I Responsive
Am I Responsive was used to preview the website across a variety of popular devices.

Tiny JPG
Tiny JPG was used to reduce the file size of the images.

Coolors
Coolors was used to create a cohesive color scheme for the website.

## Issues and Bugs

Understanding Bootstrap 5, and making sure I was aware of updates. Eg. the class "no gutters", to remove automatic padding that Bootstrap provides with rows and columns, became the class "g-0".

## Deployment

The Website was developed using Codeanywhere as the IDE, commited to Git as a local repository and finally pushed to GitHub.
