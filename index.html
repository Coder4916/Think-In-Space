    Bootstrap (BS) 5.3(https://getbootstrap.com/) was used to control:

    The general layout using grid function .row and .col
    .container-fluid to make elements responsive
    .text-center to center text
    .g-0 was used to remove BS padding
    .navbar-toggler was used to compress the nav menu  down to a 'hamburger' icon on a small screen
    The navbar menu items were set to an .inline-item also using BS

    Icons for each menu item were sourced from Font Awesome (https://fontawesome.com/)-->

                Elwyn's coaching methods have developed based on a fulfilment to adapt to different people's needs, utilising
                variety and flexibility in his work, rather than a one size fits all approach. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Elwyn's clientele have sometimes sought a more challenging approach that aims to push them outside of their 
                comfort zone, whereas on occasion a more coactive approach was successful in bringing about personal 
                progression. 
            </p>
            <p> 
                This unconventional technique has allowed Elwyn to help a varied clientele, including developing managers, 
                those seeking a career change, business owners, military personnel resettling back into civilian life, 
                entrepreneurs and third sector leaders.
