                    <p>
                        Over the last 7 years Elwyn Davies has been employed as a learning support co-ordinator working within the MOD. His clientele has included people 
                        from varied backgrounds and ethnicities. Elwyn has been able to foster a trusting and safe environment for his clients, giving them the opportunity 
                        to share their thoughts/worries/concerns. Elwyn's work has been particularly effective when working alongside those with learning differences i.e.

                <p>
                    Elwyn can draw from a vast pool of life skills and experience, having served in the Royal Air Force
                    for 22 years, he has leadership experience in both the Military and Civil Service. He has advanced
                    qualifications in coaching and mentoring as well as special educational needs and neuro-linguistic 
                    programming. He practices an holistic approach to coaching, specialising in education and
                    neurodiversity, and endeavours to support those in any preferred setting (face to face, online or outdoors).

            <h3>Tried and tested...</h3>
            <p>Elwyn's coaching methods have developed based on a fulfilment to adapt to different people's needs, utilising
                variety and flexibility in his work, rather than a one size fits all approach. Elwyn's clientele have sometimes sought
                a more challenging approach that aims to push them outside of their comfort zone, whereas on occasion a more coactive
                approach was successful in bringing about personal progression/positive change. This unconventional technique has allowed 
                Elwyn to help a varied clientele, including developing managers, those seeking a career change, business owners, military 
                personnel resettling back into civilian life, entrepreneurs and third sector leaders.
