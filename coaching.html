                    <em>Have you ever thought that you're not fulfilling your potential? That you would like to
                        be better at something, perhaps improve on a skill or hobby? Do you want to make better 
                        use of your strengths or be calmer under pressure? Have you ever looked at another person
                        and wondered how they are able to be so composed or knowledgable? What if that was you but
                        you just couldn't see it!
                    </em>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <em>The truth is we often over estimate the capabilities of others while de-valuing our own
                        strengths. For example, how many times have you criticised yourself with harsh phrases
                        and then wonder why you don't succeed. The truth is that we all need to get out of own
                        way occasionally so that we can re-write our life story and start to be our own best friend
                        rather than our worst critic.
                    </em>

                <p>
                    <em>Whether it is a work or social interaction or dealing with the challenges of life, you have
                        the resources to be a better 'you'. You already possess the necessary skills to overcome
                        the obstacles that you may have thought were too difficult. You have the in-built ability
                        to be successful. Think In Space could help you realise what you are capable of and to harness
                        your abilities to release your potential. 
                        <hr>
                        I hope that you choose me to help you navigate that journey.
